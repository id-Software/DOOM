# README for Linux DOOM Source distribution

## DISCLAIMER
This is not "The DOOM Source Code" dump for a bunch of reasons. It is based on a DOOM development directory snapshot as of January 10th, but has been stripped and changed. Thus it is the DOOM source, but there are many minor differences to the source as last used by id Software.

Note that thus neither John Carmack nor Dave Taylor nor anybody else at id is responsible for the contents of this archive, or the changes introduced to the original source.

If there are any questions, contact me at [bk@gamers.org](mailto:bk@gamers.org), or preferably post to the mailing list at [doom-editing@gamers.org](mailto:doom-editing@gamers.org)

(send mail to [majordomo@gamers.org](majordomo@gamers.org), content just a single "info doom-editing"). I will post any updates or notifcation of corrections there. I will probably put some stuff at [http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/doom/](http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/doom/)

as well. Look there for the "Unofficial DOOM Specs" as minimal recommended documentation.

## REMARKS
I made a few minor bug fixes, added some experimental sound code, and, and changed the handling of IWAD dependend game modes. Most of the changes though have been shuffling around sources in a sometimes futile attempt to separate modules more cleanly, and make certain parts easier to locate and modify. There is still much left to do, but I hope that the current source is a good base to start with, especially with a cooperative effort in mind. Those so inclined will find the source prepared for CVS.

There is a list of changes and fixes I did not get around to in TODO, and an incomplete worklog in ChangeLog, that also includes some minor ToDo statements scattered throughout the log. 

a) **Linux SVGA**: There is no SVGA support. For development and debug purposes, the X11 version seems to be more handy.

b) **Sound**: see README.sound and the sndserver.tgz archive.

c) **GLDOOM**: see README.gl

d) **Win32**: There was no Win32 support in the original dump.

e) **DOS**: Original DOS support (including the texture mapping and fixed point assembler) has been removed, mainly because of the lack of sound support.

f) **DoomEd**: The NeXTStep DoomEd sources in the dump were garbled (filenames - prolly an issue of ISO9660 with or w/o extensions). Somehow  Bear never got around to send me a list  of the correct filenames, and I won't bother guessing without a NeXT box at hand.

There is a plethora of useful editors for DOOM. I suggest using DEU for X11.

g) **BSP Tools**: The BSP builder and other tools have been released by John Carmack long ago, and since improved/replaced by others. Again, I recommend taking a pick among the tools available for Linux.  

h) **DOOM game tools**: There are a number of tools that have not been released, namely those which compiled the Things and State Tables, the frame animation LUT's, sound tables etc. Basically, they compile similarly complex LUT's to generate C files. The tools are omitted from this distribution.

There are some files in the distribution (info.h/c, sounds.h/c) that are essentially the output of these tools. This is the data that defines DOOM (as a game) for all practical purposes.

I recommend keeping them, as they are part of the source. In the long run, handling them as well as the action/animation functions as a separate game.so library (as with Quake2) seems to be a good idea.

i) **Artwork**: Neither the original artwork nor the misc. WAD files are included in this archive. You will at least need the shareware WAD file to run the executable, but it shouldn't be to difficult to get a hold of that.

Note that the mechanism to detect the presence of a registered or commercial version is still in the source, and homebrew maps are still disabled. This is easily removed now, but as FinalDOOM, Ultimate DOOM and DOOM 2 are still in the shops, it is probably polite not to distribute a source or binary without that mechanism.

This version of Linuxdoom supports Plutonia and TNT WAD from FinalDOOM as well. No guarantees, though.

Enjoy!
